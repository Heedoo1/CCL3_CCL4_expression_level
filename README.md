# Aging Reconfigures Extracellular Vesicle Signaling Driving Environmental Inflammatory Susceptibility

## Overview
This repository contains the bioinformatics analysis code used in the study  
“Aging Reconfigures Extracellular Vesicle Signaling Driving Environmental Inflammatory Susceptibility”

All bioinformatics and statistical analyses were performed exclusively using the R programming environment.  
No wet-lab experiments, sample preparation, or data generation were conducted as part of this repository.

The provided R scripts reproduce the computational analyses used to investigate age-associated alterations in extracellular vesicle (EV)–mediated signaling under environmentally driven inflammatory conditions, including UMAP-based cell-type visualization and chemokine expression comparisons.

## Data Sources
This study is based entirely on publicly available datasets.

- Transcriptomic data were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).
- GEO accession numbers are provided in the manuscript.

All analyses in this repository represent secondary bioinformatics analyses of existing datasets.  
No new experimental data were generated.

## Computational Environment

All analyses were conducted exclusively in the R programming environment.
